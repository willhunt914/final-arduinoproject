#final-arduinoproject
This is the final project in the arduino lessons it adds onto the servo project. 

My plan was to slowly work on the project one week at a time so we can get it done earlier. We also split up the project into different parts to help lighten the load of the work.  

Parts used:Breadboard, Arduino, Servo, Wires, Pushbutton, Led, 9v battery

I started the project by finishing the code and then the onshape. 

Problems: the problems that I ran into was getting the eithic to work. It was hard to get motivated to work. I got through this by starting to work and it eventually became fun to do. One other part that I struggled with was working together with my partner. We solved this eventually by just practicing over the weeks that we worked on the project. My code also stopped working so I had to tinker with that to get it working.
