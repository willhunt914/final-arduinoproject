D# final-arduinoproject
This is the final project in the arduino lessons 

our plan was to slowly work on the project one week at a time so we can get it done earlyer 

Parts used:Breadboard, Arduino, Servo, Wires, Pushbutton, Led

Problems: the problems that I ran into was getting the eithic to work. It was hard to get motivated to work. I got through this by starting to work and it eventually became fun to do.
